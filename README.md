# MC102
My solutions as a Teaching Assistant for the course MC102 - Introduction to Algorithms and Programming - 2018 - UNICAMP

ps. I'll be releasing my solutions AFTER any deadlines, so you can be able to see other ways to solve the exercises.
Keep in mind that my solutions are not always the best and/or the only possible ones.
